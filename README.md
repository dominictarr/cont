continuables in a handy-dandy grab bag, ready to go in case of an emergency.

I know grab-bags are bad practice, but, continuables have not changed in _ages_
and the name is way to long to it makes me reluctant to install them.

## package contains:

* [continuable](https://github.com/Raynos/continuable)
  `to, map, mayAsync, join, both, of, error, chain, either`
* [continuable-series](https://github.com/dominictarr/continuable-series)
